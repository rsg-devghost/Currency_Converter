# Currency_Converter
We all know how important it becomes when working with currencies of different countries, their exchange rates , real time comparisons etc. 
So it is always good to have a converter app that takes care of all the conversions and provides us with real time currency exchange values to meet our demands.
Hence I have tried to develope a robust currency converter app, [which is still in GUI, but with easy upgradibility and deployment as an app], that is capable of converting currencies of upto 7 countries.
These include almost all major countries like USA, UK , INDIA , etc.
There's also an easy upgradibility to be able to match the real time currency values, that cater the user needs!!
